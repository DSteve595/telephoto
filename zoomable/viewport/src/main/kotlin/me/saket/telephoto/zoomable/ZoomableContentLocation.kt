/**
 * For [ZoomableViewport] to be able to correctly scale and pan its content, it uses
 * [ZoomableContentLocation] to understand the content's _visual_ size and position to prevent them
 * from going out of bounds.
 *
 * [ZoomableViewport] can't calculate this on its own by inspecting its children's layout bounds
 * because that may not always match the content's visual size. For instance, an `Image` composable
 * that uses `Modifier.fillMaxSize()` could actually be drawing an image that only fills half its
 * size. An another possibility is a sub-sampled composable such as a map whose full sized content
 * could be at an order of magnitude larger than the layout bounds.
