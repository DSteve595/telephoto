Designing a _cohesive_ media experience for Android can be a lot of work. Telephoto aims to make that easier by offering some building blocks:

### [`Modifier.zoomable()`](zoomable/index.md)
Handle pan & zoom gestures in a consistent manner across your app.

### [Zoomable Image](zoomableimage/index.md)
Drop-in replacement for `Image()` composables with support for zoom gestures and sub&#8209;sampling of large bitmaps that'd otherwise not fit in memory.
